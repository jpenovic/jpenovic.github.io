    "# **Determining a Driver's Inebriation Status using Regression Analysis**\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "The United States has one of the highest rates of deaths caused by vehicles accidents involving alcohol, which is difficult to attribute to any one factor. Arguments can be made about factors including the US's car dependent infrastructure, it's culture and stigma surrounding drinking alcohol, local state and county traffic legislation, and more. One thing that can be agreed upon is that there is absolutely no reason or justification for driving while under the influence. It can be difficult for police to determine whether a traffic incident involves alcohol without conducting sobriety tests on those involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to identify factors that may indicate whether or not an accident involves an inebriated driver(s) using exploratory data analysis, and make predictions on a drivers inebriation tests using machine learning techniques such as logistic regression before police have the chance to conduct sobriety tests on involved individuals. \n",
    "### Data \n",
    "Montgomery County is Maryland's most populated county, and its residents come from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds. The data used in this project is a compiled list of traffic incidents involving collisions in Montgomery County from (date) to (date). This data was retrieved from the **U.S. Governments Public Open Data** site (`https://data.gov`) in addition to Montgomery County's Public Database, **Data Montgomery** (`https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/`). The data includes factors such as Crash Date & Time, Injury Severity, Vehicle Damage Extent, Driver Substance Abuse, and more. \n",
    "***\n",
    "## **Part 1: Data Collection, Parsing, and Management**\n",
    "Let's get all the imports that we're going to use for this project, as well as our datasets.<br>\n",
    "We'll be using two datasets provided by Data Montgomery, which are the datasets **\"Crash Reporting - Drivers Data\"**, which includes information of the driver(s) in an incident, and **\"Crash Reporting - Incidents Data**, which includes general information about the incident itself. The dataset files for this project were downloaded into the directory rather than retrieved using queries. \n",

    "Looking at the shared variables, there's important information that will help with the merge between the sets, like `Report Number` and `Driver Substance Abuse`. Each dataset has their own unique set of variables that's important to consider when performing our data analysis and regression. For example, the drivers data has information like `Injury Severity`, `Vehicle Damage Extent`, `Speed Limit`, `Vehicle Body Type`, and more. The incident data has information on `Hit/Run`, `First Harmful Event`, `Junctions`, and more which we will include.
